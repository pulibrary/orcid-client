# 2. Generated Swagger Models

Date: 2020-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Using the OrcidAPI we get back complex and deeply nested JSON objects.
- Modeling each API endpoint by hand is time consuming.

## Decision

We will use models for these objects generated by the swagger-codegen code
generation tool: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.

We will run the generator once, and add the resulting code to the lib directory. We don't intend to
maintain any changes to the generator that were required to produce these
models.

## Consequences

- We can now navigate these objects with a clean dot notation to get the data fields we need.
- As we use more of the OrcidAPI, these objects are already available to us.
- We are bringing a lot of new code into the codebase, most of which we won't
  intially use.
- Running the generator once, means we don't have to maintain the generator code.
- If a new version of this API is released, we may need to create new models.
