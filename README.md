A ruby client for searching orcid records. It's set up as a rails app in
anticipation of growth into future use cases. Initial use case is to provide command-line
functionality modeled on orcid/orcid-search.

## Swagger Client

A set of models for interacting with the Orcid REST API can be found in
`lib/swagger_client`. For more information, see ADR #0002.
